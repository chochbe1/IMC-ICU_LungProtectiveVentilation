# IMC-ICU_LungProtectiveVentilation
R code for generating lung protective ventilation (LPV) adherence measures and analysis of said measures. Here we compare adherence to Lung Protective Ventilation in an intermediate-care unit that was transformed to provide full ICU care during the COVID-19 pandemic and pre-existing MICUs. 

Two files are included here:
1) IMC-ICU_Data_Processing_Survival (R Markdown): Contains data management code to generate LPV measures, code to generate Figures 1/2 and code for Kaplan Meier curve.
2) Contains the Stata code for the negative binomial regression models reported in the manuscript.
