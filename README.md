# IMC-ICU_LungProtectiveVentilation
This repository contains example statistical code that was used to process and analyze data for a study of lung protective ventilation (LPV) and patient outcomes in an intermediate-care unit that was transformed to provide full ICU care vs pre-existing medical ICUs during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Two files are included:
1) IMC-ICU_Data_Processing_Survival (R Markdown): Data management to finalize analytic dataset, generate LPV measures, code to generate Figures 1/2 and code for Kaplan Meier curves and survival analyses.
2) covid_imc-icu_nbreg.do (Stata do-file): Contains the Stata code for the negative binomial regression models reported in the manuscript.
